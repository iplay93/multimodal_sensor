# Transformer Model for Multimodal Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Transformer-based classifier for multimodal time-series data. The model processes EEG, IMU, and PPG sensor data to classify mental states into three categories: Relaxed, Neutral, and Focused.

## Features
- Transformer-based classifier with attention extraction
- Multimodal data processing (EEG, IMU, PPG)
- Five-fold cross-validation setup
- Training and evaluation pipeline
- Attention map visualization
